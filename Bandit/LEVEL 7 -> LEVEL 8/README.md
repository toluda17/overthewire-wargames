# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

# Command Used
ls, cat, grep

This was a basic search challenge. I originally just used cat to open the file and spend the next few minutes consoling my dear laptop as it was forced to print over a 100 names and passwords. I remembered about grep, a function that searches for lines that match a pattern in a text or file:

cat data.txt | grep millionth

I then obtained the password! Easy
