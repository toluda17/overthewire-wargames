# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into Bandit Level 1.

# Commands Used
ls, cat

I used ls to list the files in the home directory and verify that the file readme was present. Then I used cat readme to display the contents of the file, which contained the password for Level 1.
