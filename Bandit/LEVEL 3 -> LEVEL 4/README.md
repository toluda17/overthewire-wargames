# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory

# Commands Used
ls, cd, cat

The password was stored in a hidden file, so I first used ls to list all directories (inhere) and then used cd to switch into inhere. After, I used 'ls -a' to show **all** files, including hidden ones. Upon seeing the hidden file, I simply read its contents with 'cat'
